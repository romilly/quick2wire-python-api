API for the LTC2631 D/A converter.

The LTC2631 is a family of 12-, 10-, and 8-bit voltage-output DACs
with an integrated, high accuracy, low-drift reference.  The chip
comes in a number of variants.

The LTC2631-L has a full-scale output of 2.5V, and operates from a
single 2.7V to 5.5V supply. The LTC2631-H has a full-scale output of
4.096V, and operates from a 4.5V to 5.5V supply.  The -M and -Z variants
reset to mid- and zero-scale respectively.

Each DAC can also operate in External Reference mode, in which a
voltage supplied to the REF pin sets the full-scale output
(this mode is not currently supported in this API).

See the data sheet at <http://www.linear.com/product/LTC2631>,
which discusses the assorted variants in more detail.

Applications talk to the chip via objects of the LTC2631 class.
When an LTC2631 object is created, it is passed a single I2CMaster,
through which it communicates.

For example:

    with I2CMaster() as i2c:
        adc = LTC2631(i2c, 'LZ12', address=0x10)
        with adc.output as output:
            # assert 2V as the output voltage
            output.set(2.0)
            ....more

The second argument to the constructor is the chip variant, which
matches the regular expression [HL][MZ](8|10|12) (for example 'HZ10'
or 'LM8').

The chip is returned to its power-off mode when the program exits the
'output' block (so the above program isn't useful as it stands).
