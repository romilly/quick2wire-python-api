API for the LTC2309 A/D converter

The LTC2309 chip has eight input pins, named CH0 to CH7, at which it
measures voltage.  These can be configured as eight single-ended
channels, or four differential channels (CH0/CH1, CH2/CH3, CH4/CH5 or
CH6/CH7).

Applications control the chip through an object of the LTC2309 clas.
This is created with an I2CMaster, through which it communicates with
the chip.

Applications may obtain one of the single-ended channels with the
method `single_ended_input`, and one of the differential channels with
the method `differential_input`.

There are nine possible addresses which the chip can have, plus one
global address which is used to instruct a suite of LTC2309 chips to
make a conversion at the same time.  This function is available
through the method `global_sync`.

See the data sheet at <http://www.linear.com/product/LTC2309>

Note that the input voltage is converted only _after_ any read or
write message to the chip (after an I2C STOP command, in fact).
Therefore if a channel is read repeatedly, the value returned is
always the value obtained after the previous read.  If two channels
are read alternately, however, then the reads are up to date (since
such an operation involves a command write, which triggers a
conversion).

For example:

    with I2CMaster() as i2c:
        adc = LTC2309(i2c, address=???)
        with adc.single_ended_input(0) as in0, adc.differential_input(2) as in2:
            print('single={}, differential2={}'.format(in0.value, in2.value)

The value of a channel is obtained by querying its `value` property.
For single-ended channels the value varies between 0 and 4.096 for
'unipolar' channels, and -2.048 and +2.048 for 'bipolar' channels,
created with single_ended_input(n, bipolar=True).  Differential
channels vary between -2.048 and +2.048.

If the channel's `sleep_after_conversion` method is called, the chip
is put into low-power sleep between conversions (as opposed to a
lowish-power 'napping' mode).
