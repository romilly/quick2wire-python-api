"""
API for the MCP3221 A/D converter.

The MCP3221 chip provides a single 12-bit measurement of an input
analogue value, available through one single-ended channel.

Applications talk to the chip via objects of the MCP3221 class.
When an MCP3221 object is created, it is passed a single I2CMaster,
through which it communicates.

For example:

    with I2CMaster() as i2c:
        adc = MCP3221(i2c)
        input = adc.single_ended_input
        print("{}".format(input.value))

The A/D signal is obtained by querying the channel's 'value' property,
which varies in the range 0.0 <= value < 1.0.
